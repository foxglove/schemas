Foxglove SDK documentation
==========================

The official `Foxglove <https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs>`_ SDK for Python.

This package provides support for integrating with the Foxglove platform. It can be used to log
events to local `MCAP <https://mcap.dev/>`_ files or a local visualization server that communicates
with the Foxglove app.


Unstable
--------

This package is currently under active development and not recommended for production use. See
`foxglove-websocket <https://github.com/foxglove/ws-protocol/tree/main/python>`_ for the currently
recommended approach.


Overview
--------

To record messages, you need at least one sink and at least one channel.

A "sink" is a destination for logged messages â€” either an MCAP file or a live visualization server.
Use :python:`record_file` or :python:`with new_mcap_file("")` to register a new MCAP sink. Use
:python:`start_server` to create a new live visualization server.

A "channel" gives a way to log related messages which have the same schema. Each channel is
instantiated with a unique topic name.

The SDK provides classes for well-known schemas. These can be used in conjunction with associated
channel classes for type-safe logging, which ensures at compile time that messages logged to a
channel all share a common schema. For example, you may create a :python:`SceneUpdateChannel` on
which you will log :python:`SceneUpdate` messages.

You can also log messages with arbitrary schemas and provide your own encoding, by instantiating a
:python:`Channel` class.
