That is, the left 3x3 portion is the normal camera intrinsic matrix for the rectified image.\n\nIt projects 3D points in the camera coordinate frame to 2D pixel coordinates using the focal lengths (fx', fy') and principal point (cx', cy') - these may differ from the values in K.\n\nFor monocular cameras, Tx = Ty = 0. Normally, monocular cameras will also have R = the identity and P[1:3,1:3] = K.\n\nFor a stereo pair, the fourth column [Tx Ty 0]' is related to the position of the optical center of the second camera in the first camera's frame. We assume Tz = 0 so both cameras are in the same stereo image plane. The first camera always has Tx = Ty = 0. For the right (second) camera of a horizontal stereo pair, Ty = 0 and Tx = -fx' * B, where B is the baseline between the cameras.\n\nGiven a 3D point [X Y Z]', the projection (x, y) of the point onto the rectified image is given by:\n\n```\n[u v w]' = P * [X Y Z 1]'\n       x = u / w\n       y = v / w\n```\n\nThis holds for both images of a stereo pair.\n"
