# foxglove_msgs/msg/ModelPrimitive
# A primitive representing a 3D model file loaded from an external URL or embedded data

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Origin of model relative to reference frame
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Scale factor to apply to the model along each axis
geometry_msgs/Vector3 scale

# Solid color to use for the whole model if `override_color` is true.
foxglove_msgs/Color color

# Whether to use the color specified in `color` instead of any materials embedded in the original model.
bool override_color

# URL pointing to model file. One of `url` or `data` should be provided.
string url

# [Media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of embedded model (e.g. `model/gltf-binary`). Required if `data` is provided instead of `url`. Overrides the inferred media type if `url` is provided.
string media_type

# Embedded model. One of `url` or `data` should be provided. If `data` is provided, `media_type` must be set to indicate the type of the data.
