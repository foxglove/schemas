# foxglove_msgs/msg/TriangleListPrimitive
# A primitive representing a set of triangles or a surface tiled by triangles

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Origin of triangles relative to reference frame
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Vertices to use for triangles, interpreted as a list of triples (0-1-2, 3-4-5, ...)
geometry_msgs/Point[] points

# Solid color to use for the whole shape. One of `color` or `colors` must be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color color

# Per-vertex colors (if specified, must have the same length as `points`). One of `color` or `colors` must be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color[] colors

# Indices into the `points` and `colors` attribute arrays, which can be used to avoid duplicating attribute data.
# 
# If omitted or empty, indexing will not be used. This default behavior is equivalent to specifying [0, 1, ..., N-1] for the indices (where N is the number of `points` provided).
uint32[] indices
