# foxglove_msgs/msg/LinePrimitive
# A primitive representing a series of points connected by lines

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Connected line segments: 0-1, 1-2, ..., (n-1)-n
uint8 LINE_STRIP=0

# Closed polygon: 0-1, 1-2, ..., (n-1)-n, n-0
uint8 LINE_LOOP=1

# Individual line segments: 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, ...
uint8 LINE_LIST=2

# Drawing primitive to use for lines
uint8 type

# Origin of lines relative to reference frame
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Line thickness
float64 thickness

# Indicates whether `thickness` is a fixed size in screen pixels (true), or specified in world coordinates and scales with distance from the camera (false)
bool scale_invariant

# Points along the line
geometry_msgs/Point[] points

# Solid color to use for the whole line. One of `color` or `colors` must be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color color

# Per-point colors (if specified, must have the same length as `points`). One of `color` or `colors` must be provided.
foxglove_msgs/Color[] colors

# Indices into the `points` and `colors` attribute arrays, which can be used to avoid duplicating attribute data.
# 
# If omitted or empty, indexing will not be used. This default behavior is equivalent to specifying [0, 1, ..., N-1] for the indices (where N is the number of `points` provided).
